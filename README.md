# Rustyboy

Gameboy emulator written in Rust.

## About

Rustyboy is nothing groundbreaking, if that's what you were looking for, then sorry to disappoint.
This doesn't do anything new or innovative, people have emulated the Gameboy in more performant ways using less 
performant languages. This project exists as a challenge to myself, could I build a Gameboy that runs anything?

## Goals
- Run Tetris
- Run Dr. Mario
- Run Pokemon Red

### Stretch
- Sound
- Gameboy Color support

### Current focus
- Implement all CPU instructions
- Get ramdomisation working
- Remove weird input lag
